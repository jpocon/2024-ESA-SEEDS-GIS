The light that is reflected back from objects is related to the brightness of light that reaches those objects. So, if you were in a room where the only source of light is the flourescent light bulb depicted in the figure above, you wouldn't expect to have light reflected off of surface with a wavelength of 400nm, because no light is being emitted in the room at 400nm.\n",

The difference between a pre-drought (A) and drought-impacted landscape (B) was chosen to highlight processes that may occur at various scales and in different locations across the landscape (aâ€“g) over the 30-yr planned AOP lifespan. Aspects of socio-environmental change that can be better understood within an AOP landscape are highlighted in comparisons of (dâ€“f) in panels A and B. For example, fine-scale resolution AOP data will allow researchers to understand drought and related human behavioral impacts on plant species composition and vegetation structure (d), canopy water content (e), and crop yields (f). In addition, AOP data combined with ancillary datasets enables analysis at larger spatial scales (C). The higher temporal resolution of other sensors can also be used to understand change within years at a NEON AOP site (C) and how pressures like reduced snowpack reverberate throughout social, governance, and ecological systems (A aâ€“g â†’ B aâ€“g).
