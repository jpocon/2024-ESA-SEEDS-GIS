    "3. **Fill in your details**: Enter your first name, last name, desired email address, and a strong password.\n",
    "4. **Verify your phone number**: Google will ask for your phone number to verify your identity. Enter your phone number and follow the prompts.\n",
    "5. **Complete the setup**: Follow the remaining instructions to complete your profile. This includes adding a recovery email, setting up security questions, and agreeing to Google's terms and conditions.\n",

    "2. **Sign in with your Gmail account**: Click on the 'Sign In' button and log in with the Gmail account you created earlier.\n",
    "3. **Request access**: After signing in, you will see an option to request access. Fill out the form with your information and the reason you want to use GEE. Mention any relevant academic or research projects.\n",
    "4. **Wait for approval**: Google typically takes a few days to review and approve your request, but you may have access immediately. You will receive an email once your access is granted. If you don't receive a confirmation by this afternoon, we can still walk through our GEE intro -- it may just be a little less engaging.\n",
