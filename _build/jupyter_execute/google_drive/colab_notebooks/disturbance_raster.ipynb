    "1. At the top of the Colab notebook that you share with everyone, please include your responses to the following questions:\n",
    "  - Choose at least 1 dataset to explore in more detail.\n",
    "  - What is the projection for this dataset?\n",
    "  - Where can you find more information on how the data were collected and how to interpret the metadata?\n",
    "  - Think about what data type each variable is.\n",
    "  - Is it vector or raster data? What properties exist for each dataset?\n",
    "  - What resolution are your data?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. At the top of the Colab notebook, write a short summary detailing the processing steps in the notebook and your results.\n",
    "  - Although these topics may be far removed from your own interests, how could these steps and analyses help in your own work?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. OPTIONAL - Expand your script by adding additional processing, analysis, or other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you're working through your exercise, **add code chunks to further document your scripts. Add additional comments to the code itself to clarify complicated processes.**\n"

    "\n",
    "The **Creek Fire** was a large wildfire that started in September 2020 in the Sierra National Forest, California and became one of the largest fires of the [2020 California wildfire season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_California_wildfires). This fire had burned into NEON's [Soaproot Saddle (SOAP)](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/soap) site by mid-September, causing a [high intensity burn over much of the site](https://www.neonscience.org/impact/observatory-blog/domain-digest-no-4-fire-field-sites-and-recovery) - standing trees became charcoal spires, shrubs and their root systems burned completely, the thick litter layer was incinerated, and the soil severely burned.\n",
