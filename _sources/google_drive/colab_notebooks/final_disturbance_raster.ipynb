This fire had burned into NEON's [Soaproot Saddle (SOAP)](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/soap) site by mid-September, causing a [high intensity burn over much of the site](https://www.neonscience.org/impact/observatory-blog/domain-digest-no-4-fire-field-sites-and-recovery) - standing trees became charcoal spires, shrubs and their root systems burned completely, the thick litter layer was incinerated, and the soil severely burned.\n",
