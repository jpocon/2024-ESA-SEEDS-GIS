## Workshop Overview

Welcome to the Four-Day GIS Workshop at Florida A&M University! This workshop is designed for graduate students with a basic understanding of GIS and remote sensing. Our goal is to enhance your ability to conceptualize, process, and analyze spatial data for ecological applications. Throughout the workshop, you will gain hands-on experience with Google Earth Engine, Google Colaboratory, and NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) data.

### Learning Objectives

<details>
<summary><b>By the end of the four-day workshop...</b></summary>
<br>
<ol>
<li><b>NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP):</b> I know what NEON AOP data are, and how to access and visualize them using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API (geemap) via browser-based Interactive Development Environment (IDE) Google Colaboratory (Colab).</li>

</ol>
</details>

### Course Structure

<details>
<summary><b>Day 1: Setup and Introduction</b></summary>
Participants will be introduced to the essential tools and platforms used throughout the workshop. The day will start with setting up necessary accounts and an introduction to Google Colaboratory. A representative from the NEON AOP will provide a technical overview via Zoom, and participants will begin working with pre-made Colab scripts to handle and conceptualize vector and raster data, which will become handy during Days 3 and 4 of the workshop when participants transition to group work.
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Day 2: NEON Site Visit</b></summary>
Participants will visit The Jones Center at Ichauway in southern Georgia. This visit will provide hands-on experience with *in situ* data collection methods and a deeper understanding of how NEON data is gathered in the field. 
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Day 3: Group Projects</b></summary>
Participants will be divided into groups and given datasets related to their interests. They will adapt pre-made Colab scripts to these new datasets, thinking through processing steps and data handling needs. Groups will start their analysis and documentation of their workflow in Google Colab.
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Day 4: Group Projects Completion & Presentation</b></summary>
Groups will finalize their data processing and analysis. They will prepare a 10-minute presentation to share their process, findings, and Jupyter Notebooks with the other groups. This collaborative session will facilitate knowledge sharing and peer feedback!

## Workshop Prerequisites

To ensure you get the most out of this workshop, please review the following prerequisites:

<details>
<summary><b>Basic Understanding of GIS and Remote Sensing Concepts</b>
You should have a foundational knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing. This includes understanding what GIS is, the types of spatial data (vector and raster), and basic concepts of remote sensing.
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Familiarity with Vector and Raster Data</b>
You should know the differences between vector and raster data, including common formats (e.g., shapefiles for vector data and GeoTIFFs for raster data). Understanding how to read metadata associated with these files will also be beneficial.
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>No Previous Programming Experience Required</b>
While previous experience with programming is not necessary, being comfortable with basic computer operations and having a willingness to learn will be helpful. All scripts provided during the workshop will be pre-made, and you will receive guidance on how to use them.
</details>
<br>

<br>

### Tools and Technology

During the workshop, we will use the following tools and technologies. Familiarize yourself with them beforehand to ensure a smooth learning experience:

<details>
<summary><b>Google Earth Engine (GEE)</b>
A cloud-based platform for planetary-scale environmental data analysis. You will use the GEE Python API (geemap) to access and visualize NEON AOP data. 
<br>
<b>Ensure you have a Google account and have requested access to GEE.</b>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Google Colaboratory (Colab)</b>
An interactive development environment that runs in your web browser. Colab allows you to write and execute Python code in Jupyter notebooks without any setup. It is essential for handling, processing, and visualizing spatial data during the workshop. Ensure your web browser is up to date -- Firefox and Chrome work best.
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Jupyter Book</b>
All workshop materials, including lecture notes, scripts, and datasets, will be organized in a Jupyter Book hosted on GitHub Pages. You will use this resource throughout the workshop to follow along with instructions and access necessary materials.
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><b>NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) Data</b>
Remote sensing data collected by NEON's airborne observation platform. Understanding how to access and work with this data will be a key part of the workshop.
</details>
<br>

## Group Deliverables

Over the course of the workshop, you will work in groups to complete the following deliverables:

- **Adapt Colab Scripts to Provided Datasets**: Each group will receive specific datasets and pre-made Colab scripts. You will adapt these scripts to process and analyze the assigned data.

- **Process and Analyze Spatial Data**: Use the adapted scripts to process the data, applying techniques learned during the workshop. Analyze the data to draw meaningful conclusions related to your research question.

- **Document Workflow and Decisions**: Keep detailed documentation of your workflow, including processing steps, decisions made, and any challenges encountered. This documentation will be part of your final presentation.

- **Prepare and Deliver a 10-Minute Presentation**: On the final day, your group will present your process, findings, and insights to the other participants. Your presentation should be clear and concise, highlighting key aspects of your analysis.

- **Share Jupyter Notebook Scripts**: Your group's Jupyter Notebook scripts should be well-documented and shared via Colab. This allows other groups to view and interact with your work during your presentation.

<br>
