# 2024 ESA SEEDS GIS Workshop Materials
This repository contains every resource and collection of scripts needed for the 2024 [Ecological Society of America's SEEDS](https://www.esa.org/seeds/) GIS Workshop held at Florida A&M University from May 20-25, 2024. This workshop is developed with support from the NSF-funded [National Ecological Observation Network (NEON)](https://www.neonscience.org/) and [Landscape Exchange Network for Socio-environmental Systems Research (LENS)](https://www.lensrcn.org/home), as well as in collaboration with [The Jones Center at Ichauway](https://www.jonesctr.org/).

## Workshop Overview

### Learning Objectives

By the end of the four-day workshop...

- **NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP):** I know what NEON AOP data are, and how to access and visualize them using GEE/Colab.
- **Spatial Data Handling: Vector & Raster:** I can explain the differences between vector and raster data, describe when they are used, describe their metadata, and collect them in the field.
- **Remote Sensing Basics:** I can describe common examples of active and passive remote sensing, and describe when they are used.
- **Spectral Indices:** I can derive soil or vegetation indices from NEON AOP and satellite data, and describe why they are ecologically relevant.
- **GIS Skillset:** I can use GEE/Colab for basic operations on NEON AOP data, including visualizing data, clipping rasters to regions of interest, calculating summary statistics, zonal statistics, engage with different file formats and file handling.
