Setting up a Gmail Account\n","\n","A Gmail account is essential for accessing various Google services, including Google Earth Engine and Google Colaboratory. Follow these steps to create your Gmail account:\n","\n","1. **Go to the Gmail website**: Open your web browser and go to [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/).\n","2. **Click on 'Create account'**: You will see an option to create a new account. Click on it.\n","3. **Fill in your details**: Enter your first name, last name, desired email address, and a strong password.\n","4. **Verify your phone number**: Google will ask for your phone number to verify your identity. Enter your phone number and follow the prompts.\n","5. **Complete the setup**: Follow the remaining instructions to complete your profile. This includes adding a recovery email, setting up security questions, and agreeing to Google's terms and conditions.\n","\n","Congratulations! You now have a Gmail account."],"id":"kaAhGHizA2d6"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Eh0Y6KNUA2d8"},"source":["## 2. Setting up a Google Earth Engine Account\n","\n","Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a powerful tool for analyzing geospatial data. Here’s how you can set up your GEE account:\n","\n","1. **Go to the Google Earth Engine website**: Open your browser and go to [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/).\n","2. **Sign in with your Gmail account**: Click on the 'Sign In' button and log in with the Gmail account you created earlier.\n","3. **Request access**: After signing in, you will see an option to request access. Fill out the form with your information and the reason you want to use GEE. Mention any relevant academic or research projects.\n","4. **Wait for approval**: Google typically takes a few days to review and approve your request, but you may have access immediately. You will receive an email once your access is granted. If you don't receive a confirmation by this afternoon, we can still walk through our GEE intro -- it may just be a little less engaging.\n","\n","Now you have access to Google Earth Engine and can start analyzing geospatial data!"],"id":"Eh0Y6KNUA2d8"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TK0-pX1eA2d_"},"source":["## 3.
